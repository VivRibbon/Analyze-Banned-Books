# Analyze-Banned-Books
Jupyter Program that pulls datasets concerning banned books in prisons, processes it with NLP and topic modeling, and visualizes it in several ways.

## About
This was the final project for my Distant Reading course as part of my master's degree in Digital Humanities at Uppsala University.

## Contents
A Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) and the paper featuring interpretation of the data. Also included is a folder containing all the output of the notebook so the data can be examined without running the program.

## Instructions

All you need is the Jupyter notebook file and a way to run it, though I recommend putting it in its own folder as the notebook will create a number of files when it's run.
Make sure you have the following libraries and their dependencies installed before running:
 ````
pandas
spacy
gensim
numpy
matplotlib
pyLDAvis
````
